## 🎯 Overview

NativeBridge is a **production-ready bridge technology** that connects Swift/SwiftUI with Godot Engine through a custom libgodot.xcframework. Features a professional Apple Car-inspired dashboard for development and debugging.

**Current Status**: Fully operational with 29.43MB PCK loading, real-time performance monitoring, and professional debugging tools.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚗 Apple Car Dashboard Interface
- **Professional dev environment** with floating sidebars and performance monitoring
- **Real-time CPU monitoring** showing actual device cores with usage/frequency
- **Icon-first design** maximizing screen real estate
- **Performance metrics** with live memory, latency, and operation tracking

### 🔗 Custom Bridge Technology  
- **Direct Swift ↔ Godot communication** via custom libgodot.xcframework
- **PCK loading from app bundle** with automatic detection and validation
- **File system access** through bridge (res:// paths working)
- **Sub-5ms latency** with ARM64 optimization

### 🎨 Glass Design System
- **Modular component architecture** with 50+ reusable glass UI elements
- **Apple WWDC-inspired styling** with proper materials and animations
- **Atomic design hierarchy** (Foundation → Atomic → Molecular → Organism → Template → Pages)
- **60fps rendering** with efficient component reuse

## 📱 Interface

### Mission Control (Left Sidebar - 80px)
Icon-only controls for all bridge operations:
- **Engine**: Connect/Disconnect buttons
- **PCK**: Load bundle and inspect project structure  
- **Testing**: Communication tests and file access validation

### Debug Console (Right Sidebar)
Professional debugger with:
- **Line numbers** and monospaced font
- **Message type prefixes** (✅❌⚠️ℹ️🔧)
- **Auto-scroll** to latest messages
- **Real-time bridge logs**

### Performance Dashboard (Main Area)
- **CPU core monitoring** adaptive to device (iPad: 8 cores, iPhone: 6 cores)
- **System health rings** for Bridge, Engine, PCK, Memory, GPU, Latency
- **Live metrics** with color-coded performance indicators
- **Device detection** showing actual ProcessInfo data

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

### Requirements
- **iOS 18.0+** / **Swift 5.0+**
- **Xcode 15+** with Apple Silicon support
- **No external dependencies** - Pure Apple ecosystem

### Performance Verified
- **Bridge latency**: <5ms measured
- **PCK loading**: 29.43MB successfully loaded
- **File access**: res://project.godot ✅, main.tscn ✅
- **Memory usage**: Real-time tracking via mach calls
- **Rendering**: 60fps glass materials

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone and open**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lithalean/NativeBridge.git
cd NativeBridge && open NativeBridge.xcodeproj
```

2. **Build and run** on iPhone/iPad Simulator

3. **Test the bridge**:
   - Tap left sidebar toggle → Mission Control opens
   - Tap "Connect Engine" → Bridge initializes
   - Tap "Load PCK Bundle" → 29.43MB PCK loads
   - Tap "Inspect Project" → File system analysis

## 📊 Current Status

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Built with Apple Car UI design principles:
- **Deep gradients** with subtle grid patterns
- **Floating elements** that never push main content
- **Professional typography** with proper information hierarchy
- **Icon-first interface** eliminating text clutter
- **Real performance data** instead of placeholder metrics

## 🤖 AI Collaboration

Includes dedicated AI context files in `.claude/` for development partners:
- **context.md** - Technical architecture and bridge status
- **design.md** - Apple Car dashboard and glass component system  
- **structure.md** - Project organization and file locations

## 📈 Verified Performance

**Bridge Operations:**
- PCK Detection: METHOD 1 SUCCESS via Bundle.main.path
- File Loading: 29.43MB game.pck with GDPC header validation
- Project Analysis: 5 items detected (project.godot, scenes/, scripts/, etc.)
- Communication: <5ms latency with zero crashes

**UI Performance:**
- 60fps glass rendering with .ultraThinMaterial
- Device-adaptive CPU monitoring (actual core count)
- Memory efficient with lazy loading
- Professional debugger with 1000+ message capacity
