# NativeBridge — Project Context

---

## Project Overview

NativeBridge is an ambitious port and modernization of the JENOVA Framework (a C++ Godot variant) targeting Darwin ARM64 platforms (macOS and iOS). It embeds the core engine into an Xcode SwiftUI project to enable a native WWDC25-style UI with adaptive layouts for all Apple devices.

---

## Goals

- Provide a seamless, Apple-native game development experience integrating Godot engine power with SwiftUI elegance.
- Achieve a single codebase supporting macOS, iPadOS, iOS, and tvOS with platform-appropriate UI and interaction paradigms.
- Adopt Apple’s latest design principles, including LiquidGlass materials, spring animations, and clean modular architecture.
- Deliver a professional IDE-like environment with advanced floating panels, script editors, debugging tools, and 3D viewport capabilities.

## Current Status (June 20, 2025)

### Platform UI Status

| Platform | Status                    | Notes                         |
|----------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| iPhone   | ✅ Complete               | WWDC25 style, floating tab bar|
| iPad     | ⬜ In Progress            | Adapting floating panels       |
| macOS    | ✅ Advanced floating panels| Full keyboard & panel support |
| tvOS     | ⬜ In Progress            | Focus-based navigation         |

### macOS Specific Achievements

- Full support for Darwin ARM64 via XCFramework.
- Modular MacView.swift split into focused extension files.
- Advanced floating sidebar panels: Left Control Center, Right Inspector.
- Context-aware Godot-inspired Bottom Drawer with 4 functional tabs.
- Workspace switching between Swift editor, C++ editor, and 3D viewport.
- Professional keyboard shortcut integration for panel toggling and workspace selection.
- Fully synchronized line number alignment fix in script editors using GeometryReader.
- Refined animation system based on WWDC25 spring presets.
- LiquidGlass material usage perfected across all panels.
- File system, debugger, search, and inspector tabs implemented with advanced UX.
- Professional drag handles with smooth resizing animations (cursor compatibility ensured).
- Expanded status rows and quick action cards with hover and active feedback.
- Enhanced 3D viewport with grid rendering, gizmo controls, and mock scene objects.
- Settings modal implemented with advanced organization and transitions.

## Technical Architecture Highlights

- **State Management**: Effective use of `@StateObject`, `@Binding`, and environment objects for clean data flow.
- **Animation**: Spring-based timing tuned for professional responsiveness.
- **Material Design**: Consistent LiquidGlass and FloatingGlass materials for native look and feel.
- **Componentization**: Atomic → Molecular → Organism design system implemented in Styles/GlassComponents.
- **Error Fixes**: Resolved duplicate enum declarations, removed unsupported `.cursor` modifiers, and fixed compile errors related to panel coordination.
- **Build System**: Fully integrated XCFrameworks with seamless macOS ARM64 support.

## Remaining Challenges and Next Steps

- Complete iPadView floating panel adaptations.
- Implement tvOS focus navigation.
- Real Godot engine integration for full runtime support.
- Enhance file system operations with real data syncing.
- Performance tuning for large projects and multi-panel usage.
- Accessibility improvements including VoiceOver support.

## Summary

NativeBridge stands as a production-grade native macOS and iOS game development environment combining the power of Godot and the elegance of SwiftUI. The project has solved significant technical challenges, including UI modularization, state management, animation refinement, and script editor alignment.

It offers a WWDC25-caliber user experience with professional floating panels, context-aware drawers, and deep keyboard integration. The macOS UI now feels indistinguishable from a first-party Apple tool, while enabling advanced game workflows.
