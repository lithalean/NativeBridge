## 🔧 Known Technical Debt
```
HIGH_PRIORITY:
- Basic Godot App Embedding: Core bridge functionality not yet implemented
- SwiftUI Wrapper Components: Need component library for Godot scene integration
- Build System Configuration: Debug/release configs need proper GameEngine linking

MEDIUM_PRIORITY:
- Message Passing System: Bidirectional Swift ↔ Godot communication incomplete
- Memory Safety: Automatic marshaling system needs implementation
- Error Handling: Comprehensive logging and propagation system needed

PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION:
- Bridge latency optimization for <5ms target achievement
- Memory management optimization for <10MB overhead limit
- Hot-reload performance tuning for <5s debug cycle target
```

## 🎯 Next Development Priorities
```
IMMEDIATE (This Week):
1. Basic Godot App Embedding - Core bridge functionality implementation - [COMPLEXITY: HIGH]
2. SwiftUI Wrapper Components - Godot scene container views - [COMPLEXITY: MEDIUM]
3. Basic Scene Loading - Test integration with simple Godot scenes - [COMPLEXITY: MEDIUM]

SHORT_TERM (This Month):
1. Swift → Godot Message Passing - Bidirectional communication system
2. Build System Configuration - Debug/release with proper linking
3. Memory Safety Implementation - Automatic data marshaling system

ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS_NEEDED:
- Message Passing Protocol: Direct C++ calls vs message queue for Swift ↔ Godot
- Memory Management: Automatic vs manual lifecycle for bridge objects
- Scene Integration: Embedded views vs full-screen takeover for Godot content
```

## 🐛 Bug Tracking & Issues
```
CRITICAL:
- GameEngine xcframework linking issues in some build configurations | Test all targets | Blocks basic functionality

HIGH:
- SwiftGodotKit integration warnings in Xcode | Update dependency configuration | Development workflow friction

MEDIUM:
- Simulator performance slower than device | Profile bridge overhead | Developer experience issue

ENHANCEMENT_REQUESTS:
- Real-time bridge performance monitoring | Visual debugging interface for message passing
- Automatic Swift wrapper generation | Code generation tools for Godot classes
```
