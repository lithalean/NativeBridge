1. GodotBridge.initialize() → Engine startup
2. GameControllerManager.init() → Controller detection + setup
3. PCKManager.forceRedetection() → Find game.pck  
4. GodotBridge.loadResourcePack() → Load 29.43MB PCK
5. ControllerUIManager.setupControllerNavigation() → Ring selection ready
6. GodotBridge.fileExists() → Verify file access
7. GodotBridge.listDirectory() → Inspect project structure
8. Controller input → ControllerUIManager → Ring selection + haptic feedback
```

### Enhanced Manager Coordination Pattern
```swift
// BridgeManager orchestrates (Enhanced):
- GodotEngineManager: Engine lifecycle + custom bridge ops
- PCKManager: Bundle detection + file management  
- GameControllerManager: Controller detection + input handling + debug logging
- ControllerUIManager: Ring selection navigation + haptic feedback integration
- Apple Car Dashboard: Real-time performance rings + dual sidebar system
- Debug Console: Live bridge + controller communication logging
```

### Controller Integration Pattern (NEW)
```swift
// Controller → UI Navigation Flow:
1. GameControllerManager.checkForConnectedControllers() → Detection
2. ControllerUIManager.setupControllerNavigation() → Input handlers
3. D-pad input → navigateLeft/Right() → selectedButton update
4. A button → activateSelected() → Ring action (engine, PCK, haptics)
5. Haptic feedback → triggerHapticFeedback() → UIImpactFeedbackGenerator
6. Debug logging → addDebugMessage() → Color-coded console display
```
