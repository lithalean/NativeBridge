B Button           → Cancel action (with haptic feedback)
Menu Button        → Toggle sidebars (prepared for implementation)
Left/Right Stick   → Logged but not mapped to UI (available for future use)
Triggers           → Logged but not mapped to UI (available for future use)
```

RightDebuggerSidebar(bridgeManager, onClose)          # Professional debug console
BigIconButton(icon, color, isEnabled, action)         # Icon-only sidebar buttons
DetailedControllerStatus(controllerManager)           # Controller info card

// Debug Components
DebuggerLogLine(lineNumber, message, messageType)     # Color-coded debug lines
ControllerDebugButton(controllerManager)              # Controller diagnostics

// Foundation Components
AppleCarBackground()                                   # Grid + ambient effects

## 🔄 State Management & Real-Time Updates

### Enhanced Manager Integration
```swift
// Complex State Orchestration
@StateObject bridgeManager = BridgeManager()           # Bridge + engine + PCK state
@StateObject controllerUIManager = ControllerUIManager # Controller navigation state  
@StateObject pckManager = PCKManager()                # PCK detection state

// Real-time data flow:
- Controller input → ControllerUIManager → Ring selection updates
- Bridge operations → BridgeManager → Ring status updates  
- Debug messages → BridgeManager → Console auto-scroll
- Performance metrics → Timer-based updates → Ring progress animation
```

### Advanced Animation System
```swift
// Sophisticated Animation Coordination
Ring selection: Pulsing white outline with scale animation (0.6s repeat forever)
Sidebar toggles: Spring physics with proper damping + response
Ring progress: Smooth circular progress with 1.0s easeInOut
Debug console: Auto-scroll with 0.3s easeOut animation
Controller feedback: Haptic feedback coordinated with visual feedback
